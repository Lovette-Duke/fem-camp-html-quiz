		<h2>
			Week 1
		</h2>
		<article><p>
			The Dufuna FEM camp program started with full force taking some people unaware (eg. me). <br>Our 1st challenge for the week was <strong>Business Logic: A guide to software product development</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, I was not going to fall to that side. You know "<em>well they fall where they fall</em>". <br>If you catch my drift then you must have seen the movie <b><i>Author the legend of Excalibar</i></b>, hmmm love that movie.
		</p>
		<p>
			Well, after all said and done I was able to successfull(for the most part) <br>drag my self into the program and continued to Week 2. Hmm (heavy sigh).
