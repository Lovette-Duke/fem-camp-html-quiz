		<h2> Week 2</h2>
		<p> 
			Hmmm (heavy sigh) here we are <b>Week 2</b> with the 2nd challenge for the code camp <strong>Version Control and IDE setup</strong>.
		</p>
		<p>
			One look at the challenge tittle and I was like 'my not Github', learning git and<br> github just feels exhausting. But still won't fall that side, would we now.
		</p>
		<p>
			And finally I managed to go through it and hmmmmmmmm, finally one small git and github battle won.
